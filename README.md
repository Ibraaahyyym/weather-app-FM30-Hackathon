# Weather App – FM30 Hackathon  

A responsive weather application built as part of the **Frontend Mentor FM30 Hackathon 2025**.  
This project fetches live weather data from the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) and displays current conditions and forecasts with a clean, responsive design.
